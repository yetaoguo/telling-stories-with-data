# Persons in Crisis Calls for Service Attended
 
##overview
This term paper investigates the persons in crisis call for service attended in Toronto from January 2014 to December 2023. By rebuilding the database, we can generate two graphs exploring the frequency of different crisis events and the distribution of event hours by event name. The frequency graph shows a consistent upward trend, suggesting that the number of emergency calls from People in Crisis has increased due to the stress caused by the pandemic. Besides, a box plot shows how long it takes for different events to occur. This report aims to inform the Canadian government of the importance of developing more effective crisis management strategies in urban settings and to enhance the mental health of citizens in metropolitan areas.
